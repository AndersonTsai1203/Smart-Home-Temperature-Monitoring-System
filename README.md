# Smart Home Temperature Monitoring System

Build a smart home temperature monitoring system where multiple IoT devices (like Raspberry Pi or Arduino) collect temperature data and send it to AWS IoT Core. You can visualize the data in real-time using Amazon QuickSight.

## Components

1. Temperature sensor (DHT11)
2. Raspberry Pi or Arduino
3. AWS IoT Core
4. Amazon QuickSight

## Features

- Monitor temperature data in real-time.
- Set alerts for specific temperature thresholds using AWS Lambda.

## Extensions

Add humidity monitoring, or integrate a fan that automatically turns on/off based on temperature.
